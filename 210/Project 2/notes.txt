1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.


    A "LinkedDeque" was the main goal of this project. This is a special kind of computer queue that can add or remove things from both ends.
    In a way, it was like setting up a shop line (or "queue") so that buyers could be served from both the front and the back.
    It reminded me of a linked list project I worked on over the summer,
    and it had both familiar and new tasks that helped me learn how to organize and manage data well in a computer setting.

    A "doubly-linked list" was used for this project, which is different because each point (or "node") has a relationship to both its next neighbor and its previous neighbor, making a two-way link.
    Working with data in this two-way linked setting really helped me improve my ability to think logically and solve problems.
    It was especially helpful to learn how to code in a way that let us easily add, peek, and remove things from our data structure while making sure that each piece of data kept its connections correctly.



2. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS210 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   Name               Status       Help Received
   ----               ------       -------------

   ...                ...          ...
